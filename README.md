# HEmpute

The UTHealth presents secure outsourcing genotype imputation using a linear prediction model based on two different homomorphic encryption frameworks - BFV and CKKS. 

### Training:
HEmpute-Train builds the linear models for secure imputation pipelines of UTHealth-CKKS and UTHealth-BFV. 

### Evaluation:
HEmpute-Evaluation provides a C++ implementation of our secure genoteype imputation protocol.
