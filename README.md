# HEmpute

The UTHealth&Microsoft Research team presents secure outsourcing genotype imputation protocols using a linear prediction model based on two different homomorphic encryption frameworks - BFV and CKKS. 

## Training
HEmpute-Train builds the linear models for secure imputation pipelines of UTHealth-BFV and UTHealth-CKKS. You can see the detail description and instruction in the "HEmpute-Train" directory. 


## Testing
HEmpute-Test provides a C++ implementation of our secure genoteype imputation protocol. You can see the detail description and instruction in the "HEmpute-Test" directory.
